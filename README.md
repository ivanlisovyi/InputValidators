# InputValidators

Simple Objective-C solution for text validation.

Currently available validators:

* Required validator
* Email validator
* Alpha validator
* Numeric validator
* Length validator
* Regex validator
* Multiple validator

## Important
The latest version `1.0.0` contains breaking changes and it is **not backward compatible** with previous latests version `0.3.3`. In case if you need a support for pre iOS7 versions use previous latest version `0.3.3`.

## Requirements
* Xcode 7.0 or higher
* iOS 7.0 or higher
* ARC

## Installation

### CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating `InputValidators` is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager.

Edit your Podfile and add InputValidators:

``` bash
pod 'InputValidators'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

### Manual Install

All you need to do is drop `InputValidators` files into your project, and add `#import "LKValidators.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

### Text Validation

``` objective-c
NSString *email = @"email@example.com"

InputValidator *validator = [LKEmailValidator validator];
NSError *error = nil;
BOOL isValid = [validator validate:email error:&error];

if (!isValid) {
  NSLog(@"%@", [error localizedFailureReason]);
}
```

### Text Validation with multiple validators

``` objective-c
NSString *email = @"email@example.com"

LKValidator *validator = [LKMultipleValidator validator];
validator.validators = [[LKRequiredInputValidator validator], [LKEmailInputValidator validator]];
NSError *error = nil;
BOOL isValid = [LKValidator validate:email error:&error];

if (!isValid) {
  NSLog(@"%@", [error localizedFailureReason]);
}
```
